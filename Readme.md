# Project Japanese Light Novels

Hello World!
I am Knight Shrestha.
This is a Project that has been on my mind for a very long time. The idea is to have an app tht can track the japanese light novels. There are alternatives like Anilist, but I wanted something that would include only japanese light novels.

## Roadmap

- Search and browse functionality: Allow users to search for light novels based on titles, authors, genres, or keywords. Implement filters and sorting options to make it easier for users to find specific light novels.

- Detailed information: Provide comprehensive details about each light novel, including the title, author, illustrator, publisher, release date, synopsis, and any available reviews or ratings.

- Favorites and reading lists: Allow users to mark light novels as favorites or add them to reading lists for easy access and tracking. This feature can help users keep track of their progress and plan their reading.

- Recommendations: Implement a recommendation system that suggests light novels based on a user's reading history, favorite genres, or similar light novels they have enjoyed. This can enhance user engagement and introduce them to new titles.

- User reviews and ratings: Enable users to write reviews and rate light novels. This feature encourages community engagement and helps other users make informed decisions about which light novels to read.

- Reading progress tracking: Offer a feature that allows users to track their reading progress within each light novel. It can include features like bookmarks, chapter markers, and progress indicators.

- Community features: Include social aspects like user profiles, user-generated content (such as fan art or discussions), forums, or chat rooms where users can connect, share recommendations, and discuss light novels.
