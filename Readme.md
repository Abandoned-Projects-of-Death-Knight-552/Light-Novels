# Project Japanese Light Novels

![Logo](images/Project.jpg)

Hello World!

I am Knight Shrestha.
This is a project that has been on my mind for a very long time. This is an app that will display information on light novels.

⚠️ YOU CANNOT USE THIS APP TO DOWNLOAD LIGHT NOVELS ⚠️

You can add new novels to reading list, track status and maybe see recommendations.

## Features

- [ ] Search and browse functionality:
  - [x] Add light novels to remote database. ( Currently, 829 Records )
  - [ ] Sync Local RoomDB and Remote Neon Tech Postgres database.
  - [ ] Add different sorting method (by name, by status, etc).
  - [ ] Add search features ( not fuzzy search ).
  - [ ] Add filters such as genres, authors, etc.

## Planned Features

- Search and browse functionality: Allow users to search for light novels based on titles, authors, genres, or keywords. Implement filters and sorting options to make it easier for users to find specific light novels.

- Detailed information: Provide comprehensive details about each light novel, including the title, author, illustrations, synopsis, and genres.

- Favorites and reading lists: Allow users to mark light novels as favorites or add them to reading lists for easy access and tracking. This feature can help users keep track of their progress and plan their reading.

## Hoped Features

- Recommendations: Implement a recommendation system that suggests light novels based on a user's reading history, favorite genres, or similar light novels they have enjoyed. This can enhance user engagement and introduce them to new titles.

- User reviews and ratings: Enable users to write reviews and rate light novels. This feature encourages community engagement and helps other users make informed decisions about which light novels to read.

- Reading progress tracking: Offer a feature that allows users to track their reading progress within each light novel. It can include features like bookmarks, chapter markers, and progress indicators.

- Community features: Include social aspects like user profiles, user-generated content (such as fan art or discussions), forums, or chat rooms where users can connect, share recommendations, and discuss light novels.

## Related Projects
